- Obviously I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/leocth).
- I use Discord a lot, and here's an [invite](https://discord.gg/NeNfePzCx8).
  to my cozy hideout, just for you. <j>(Not really)</j>
- I upload videos occasionally to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UCfVDQlFd1pGiNfjFdG-Gamw) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/401096522).
- If you wish to contact me by email, the address's
  <BotsPlsGoAway>
	  <code>leocth31 (a) gmail.com</code>
  </BotsPlsGoAway>.

- I have a [Tw*tter account](https://twitter.com/@leocth31), but I don't use it   
  'cause IMHO, Tw*tter's a _shitty_ platform. I'll probably do a rant on this later.
- Nor do I have [Facebook](https://facebook.com) nor an
  [Instagram](https://instagram.com) account, since they're almost equally as bad.

I actually have a [LinkTree](https://linktr.ee/leocth) page containing many of the same links you see here. Yup, that's also an option!
