I'm just a guy on the internet.
Student, zoomer, self-educated lazy programmer, procrastinator extraordinaire.
And *occasionally*, I ramble about stuff. 

I like programs that are easy to understand for humans, fast to execute for computers, safe to run for years and decades to come.
It is for this reason that I am a huge [Rustacean](https://rust-lang.org/).
([Ferris](https://rustacean.net) would be proud of me, lol).
[I am even planning to teach other people how to do so](/rfab/what/),
published online for everyone to watch.

I like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
I've created a number of Minecraft mods in the past, but recently I have run out of attention and energy to maintain them and perfect them further â€“
Minecraft is such a *horrible* platform to develop on,
that neither mature toolchains like [Forge](https://minecraftforge.net)
nor the more new and innovative ones like [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) or
[Quilt](https://quiltmc.org) could save this dumpster fire.
Let's just hope they'll get better; Mojang's beyond saving.

I speak English and Mandarin, and write in English and (Simplified) Chinese.
I'm also learning German (A2).
The language toggle switch is in the bottom-right corner, you're welcome. My timezone's in UTC+8, so you could probably figure out where I live now, lol.
